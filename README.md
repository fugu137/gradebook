# Gradebook
*This gradebook application is an ongoing personal project and not intended for commercial use. I have used Microsoft Windows 10 icons and styling as a learning tool to practice JavaFX CSS and FXML/Scenebuilder. I do not own the rights to the icons, so if you would like to use the software for yourself, please replace them with your own first.*

## Manage Student Info and Grades
Gradebook was made using JavaFX, as both an application I can use in my teaching, and as a project to practice Java and to learn JavaFX. It uses the Command Pattern to implement undo/redo functionality, SceneBuilder and JavaFX CSS to mimic the UI from Windows 10 Explorer, and makes use of many of JavaFX's features(e.g., TableView, ComboBox, CheckBox, MenuButton, ToggleButton, BarChart, PieChart). 

You can download and try it on Windows [here](https://github.com/fugu137/gradebook/releases/download/v0.9.0/gradebook.exe). (Sample class lists and a sample save file can be found by clicking `Releases > Assets` on this page and downloading the `.csv` and `.gbk` files.)
